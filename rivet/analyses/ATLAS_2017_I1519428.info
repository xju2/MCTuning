RunInfo: <Jets are reconstructed by the anti-kT algorithm with R = 0.4. Each event is required to have two leading jets ordered by their transverse momentum passing pT > 400 (60) GeV, respectively.>

Description:
	'<Dijet events are studied in the proton--proton collision dataset recorded at $\sqrt{s}$ =13~TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 3.5 fb$^{−1}$ and 33.5 fb^{−1} respectively. Invariant mass and angular distributions are compared to background predictions and no significant deviation is observed.>'

ToDo:
 - Implement the analysis, test it, remove this ToDo, and mark as VALIDATED :-)
